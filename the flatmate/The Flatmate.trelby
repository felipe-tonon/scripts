._PHIL
.:No problem, here's the key
>.Phil pulls a set of keys from his left pocket and throws it

.:move in?

._PHIL
>:Great! Just leave your deposit on
.:the kitchen table.
..Phil starts to open the door to leave but stops himself.
._PHIL

.:stains already.
..Adam chuckles
._ADAM
.:Don't worry, I don't drink
._PHIL
>:What?! How can you... Ok! We'll
.:discuss this later!

>:I got a response saying I should
.:call and book a face to face...

.:understand that.

..room, where the alarm clock still rings.
.\INT. APARTMENT HALL
._ADAM (CONT'D)
.((walking)

.\INT. ADAM'S ROOM - EVENING(THURSDAY)
>.Adam's bed is meticulously made. Books are carefully piled

>.concentrated with his back to the room's closed door. He
>.wears in-ear headphones and discreetly nods in agreement to
>.a man moving on his phone's screen. The video is title
..'Ethics and Finance'.
>.Laying on his desk right in front of him there is his open
>.wooden box. To the side of it there's his phone. Adam keeps
>.changing his glance between both objects while his hands
>.move repetitively inside of the box. There is a scrapping
..sound.

.:Party time!

._PHIL
>:Chill the fuck down! What's wrong
.:with you?

.:Me? What's wrong with knocking?
._PHIL
>((trying to look around
.(Adam)
|:What's in that box?
>:Adam tilts his body slightly to
>:block Phil's vision of the wooden
.:box.
._ADAM
|:Nothing!
>:Phil hands one of the beers to
.:Adam.
._PHIL
>:Well anyways, let's knock these
.:pre-gaming babies down and go out
..Adam holds the beer instinctively.
._PHIL (CONT'D)
>:...to perpetuate men's ancient and
|:sacred search for pussy!
>:Phil still curious, tries to have
.:another look at the box.
._PHIL (CONT'D)
>:Is that drugs? Because I could
|:really use a line of...
.:ADAM
.((losing his patience)
|:Mate! You know I don't even drink
|:and for the hundredth fucking time
>:Adam throws the closed can of beer
>:out of the room and across the
>:door. It hits the hallway's wall
.:and cracks open against the floor.
._ADAM (CONT'D)
.((getting angry)
>:I need to get my life together and
>:I can't just live for getting drunk
.:and humping myself senseless!

._PHIL (CONT'D)
>:I won't help you into a normal
.:social life anymore!
>.Phil turns around and starts walking out of the room. He
>.stops near the door and turns back again to speak to Adam
..one more time.
._PHIL
>:You shouldn't be watching that
>:bullshit anyways! The real money
>:lies behind the lines drawn by
|:ethics and legality
>:Adam opens a book and looks for a
.:specific page.
._ADAM
|:That's a popular thinking in prison
|:PHIL
.:By the way, you owe me a beer
._ADAM
.((without looking back)
.:Door!
..Phil walks away leaving the door open instead.
.\INT. CORPORATE CAFETERIA - NOON (MONTHS LATER)
>.Phil shares a table with other strangers in ties. It is
>.lunchtime and the place is full. He eats quietly when his
>.phone vibrates. He drops the fork and pulls the mobile from
..his pocket.
._SCREEN
>:Adam: Hey asshole! My 3 months
>:probation ended today! I am
|:permanently employed now :D
>:He opens a big smile and starts
.:typing excited.
.\INT. CITY TRAM
>.Adam has a confident smirk. He is standing up, one hand
>.holding to an bar while his body rocks lightly as the tram
..moves. The other hand holds the phone he's looking at.

>:celebration! No pussying out this

._PHIL
.:Adam!! Finally
.\INT. PUB - NIGHT (HOURS LATER)

._ADAM
.((speaking drunk)
>:I couldn't even breath inside that
.:office today without signing...

._ADAM (CONT'D)
>:a non-disclosure agreement as thick
.:as your head
._PHIL
.:Sure buddy, whatever you say.
>.Phil sits at a perpendicular side of the table and puts down
..both glasses.
._PHIL (CONT'D)
>:Now have a bit of water, it's gonna
.:make you feel better
>.Phil pushes the pint of water over the table on Adam's
..direction but Adam ignores it completely.
._ADAM
>:They're calling it a company merge,
>:but it's more like some corporate
.:butcher-fucking
._PHIL
>:You're not making any sense again!
>:Just drink your water and relax.
.:We'll be home soon.
>.Phil takes a sip out of his full glass of beer while he
..listens to Adam speaking.
._ADAM
>:They're gonna buy Infothought, chop
>:that company up and sell each
.:little piece to the highest bidder
..Phil raises his eyebrows.
._PHIL
.((surprised)
>:Really?! That's some tasty
>:privileged information you've got
.:there!
>.Phil pulls his mobile phone from this back pocket and slides
..his finger to unlock the device.
._ADAM
>:And profiting from inside
.:information like this
..Adam tries not to burp.
._ADAM (CONT'D)
>:...can get us both up to five years
>:in a Swiss jail! So shut the fuck
.:up!
._PHIL
.:Five years? How do you...
..Phil remembers the answer.
._PHIL (CONT'D)
.:Oh, that's what you did time for!
>.Adam nods in agreement. Phil goes back to looking at his
..phone and starts typing.
._PHIL
>:Don't worry, it's not my first time
>:and my broker is very discreet.
>:He'll just move some investments
>:around and we'll make shit loads of
.:money.
._ADAM
.:Motherfu...
>.Adam slaps the phone out of Phil's hand, it flies and lands
..a couple of meters away from their table.
._PHIL
>:Come on! Enough with your Britney
.:moments!
>.Phil stands up from the table, walks to his phone, picks it
>.up and his thumbs immediately start moving on the mobile's
..screen.
._PHIL
>:Done! Sent! Now my broker is gonna
>:do his magic and let the money fly
.:in!
..Hearing that fills Adam with drunken rage.
._ADAM
.:I'm gonna kill you!
>.Adam stands up quickly and tries to move towards Phil, but
>.instead he trips after his first step, falls face first on
..the floor and passes out.
.\INT. PRISON'S VISITATION AREA - DAY (MONTHS LATER)
>.We see a prisoner's feet walking into scene and sitting on a
>.chair. Another pair of feet walks in, this one with
>.impeccably shone black leather shoes and perfectly fitted
..formal trousers.
._PHIL
>:You testified against me, huh? You
.:little shit!
._ADAM
.:Sorry mate, I couldn't risk...
._PHIL
.((interrupting)
>:Nah, it wasn't you. I was balls
>:deep into lady justice's asshole
.:doing all kinds of shit
..Phil looks down in regret.
._PHIL (CONT'D)
>:She had to fuck me back at some
.:point
._ADAM
.:Still... I don't know...
._PHIL
.:Yeah
..An awkward silence takes over for a brief moment.
._ADAM
.:By the way, I've taken your room
._PHIL
>:It's alright. Just don't do like me
>:and rent the spare one to some
.:homeless bum off the street
>.They both smile uncomfortably at each other. Another moment
..of awkward silence follows.
._PHIL
>:By the way, I have spoken to my
.:boss about you
._ADAM
.:Oh right
._PHIL
>:He has agreed to take you in for an
.:interview
._ADAM
>:Really?! That's great! Does he
.:know...
._PHIL
.((interrupting)
>:Yes, and he also knows you didn't
>:fuck up during my trial so he's
.:willing to consider you
._ADAM
.((getting excited)
.:Man! That would be...
..He interrupts himself when he sees Phil's serious expression
._PHIL
>:Yeah! Don't be too happy about
.:taking MY job!
._ADAM
.:Sorry mate
._PHIL
>:Look at you! Apartment, job... I
.:guess you got everything you wanted
>.Adam nods timidly in agreement and another moment of awkward
..silence takes over.
.\INT. SAME APARTMENT's HALLWAY - DAY
>.A middle aged female real estate agent walks slowly out of
>.the living room moving towards the apartment's front door as
>.she is followed by Adam. She has a friendly German accent
>.and holds a freshly signed tenancy agreement in front of her
..body with both hands.
>.Adam is now very distinctly dressed. He has a confident and
..successful aura around him.
._REAL ESTATE AGENT
>:So the landlord was happy to have
.:the contract in your name
._ADAM
.:Perfect! I'm glad he agreed
._REAL ESTATE AGENT
>:Now, do you plan to rent out the
.:other room?
._ADAM
.:Nah!
>.He pauses for a moment until he realises she's waiting him
..to elaborate on his answer.
._ADAM
.:I hate flatmates!
